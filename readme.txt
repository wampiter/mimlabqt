This is the qtlab (and perhaps other python) lab folder for mimlab.

scirpts, data, instruments, and modules are linked up with qtlab appropriately.

Instructions for use:

Use the qtlab shortcut to boot qtlab. From there you run scripts within your scripts folder, modules in modules, etc. See the qtlab manual for more info. Do not modify anything in the qtlab folder (unless you absolutely have to). This makes it easy to update and maintain the framework.

We'll work out more details about what to do with modules, instrument drivers, etc, later...
